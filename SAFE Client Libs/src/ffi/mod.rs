//! This module provides FFI-bindings to the Client Modules (`core`, `nfs`, `dns`)
//! In the current implementation the allocations made by this crate are managed within the crate
//! itself and is guaranteed that management of such allocations will not be pushed beyond the FFI
//! boundary. This has a 2-fold outcome: firstly, the passing of data is done by filling of the
//! allocations passed by the caller and is caller's responsibility to manage those. For this every
//! function that fills an allocated memory also has a companion function to return the size of
//! data which the caller can call to find out how much space needs to be allocated in the first
//! place. Second and consequently, the caller does not have to bother calling functions within
//! this crate which only serve to free resources allocated by the crate itself. This otherwise
//! would be error prone and cumbersome. Instead the caller can use whatever idiom in his language
//! to manage memory much more naturally and conveniently (eg., RAII idioms etc)
//!
//! The only exception to the above rule is the obtainment of the client engine itself. The client
//! engine is allocated and managed by the crate. This is necessary because it serves as a context
//! to all operations provided by the crate. Hence the user will obtain the engine on calling any
//! one of the functions to create it and must preserve it for all subsequent operations. When
//! done, to release the resources, `drop_client` may be called.
