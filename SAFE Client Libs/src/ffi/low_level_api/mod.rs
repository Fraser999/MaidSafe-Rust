/// Object handle associated with objects. In normal C API one would expect rust code to pass
/// pointers to opaque object to C. C code would then need to pass these pointers back each time
/// they needed rust code to execute something on those objects. However our code base deals with
/// communication over Web framework (like WebServers for instance). Hence it is not possible to
/// pass pointers to remote apps interfacing with us. Pointers represent handle to actual object.
/// Using similar concept, we instead pass ObjectHandle type over Web interface and manage the
/// objects ourselves. This leads to extra type and memory safety and no chance of Undefined
/// Behaviour. Passing of pointer handles to C is replaced by passing of ObjectHandle to remote
/// apps which they will use to do RPC's.
