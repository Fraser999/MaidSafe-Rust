# Safe Core - Change Log

## [0.22.1]
- API to get MAID-Public signing key.

## [0.22.0]
- New error type - MutationError::DataTooLarge.
- New Delete handling and update of code and test cases.
- New APIs - Put to re-claim deleted data (specify version), make data unclaimable.
- Changes and fixes in mock-routing to conform to routing and vaults for error deduction and error types.

## [0.21.2]
- Serialisation and deserialisation for Sign Keys.
- API for getting Filtered keys from AppendableData.
- Fix accidental name mangling of C function.

## [0.21.1]
- Reverting the commit to remove dir-tag from dir-key: commit e829423 reverts commit 4fbc044.
- Trim credentials in examples to not include a `\n`.

## [0.21.0]
- Removal of base64 indirection as we no longer have JSON interface to `safe_core`.
- Many more test cases to thoroughly check low-level-api
- Add new api's wanted by launcher - ownership assertion, version exposure, more serialisations etc.
- Make tag-types for versioned and unversioned StructuredData MaidSafe constants and remove them from `DirectoryKey`.

## [0.20.0]
- API changed from JSON to direct FFI calls for interfacing with other languages.
- Provide low-level-api for finer grained control for manipulation of MaidSafe data types.
- Provide Private & Public Appendable Data operations and manipulations.
- Code APPEND API.
- Update mock-routing to comply with above changes to mimic basic routing and vault functionality for purposes of independent testing.
- Introduce Object Caching - a method in which `safe_core` keeps cache of object in LRU cache and gives only a POD (u64) handle via FFI.
- Increase test cases performace when using mock routing by not writing data to file for test-cases.
- Dependency update - routing updated to 0.26.0.

## [0.19.0]
- Dependency update - routing updated to 0.23.4.
- Log path exposed to FFI so that frontend is intimated where it is expected to create its log files.
- Dependency on rust_sodium instead of sodiumoxide and removal of libsodium instruction from CI builds.

## [0.18.1]
- Dependency update - routing reduced to 0.23.3 and safe_network_common increased to 0.7.0.

## [0.18.0]
- Requests made to safe_core will now timeout after 2 min if there is no response from routing.
- Self-encrypt write used by safe_core via sequential encryptor will now try to put data onto the Network immediately if possible leading to better progress indication across FFI.
- Logging added to safe_core.
- Accessing DNS will not do a bunch of checks which it used to previously because it lead to erroneous corner cases in which one user could not access websites created by other before they created their own DNS first etc.

## [0.17.0]
- Instead of requiring all 3 of PIN, Keyword and Password, have user type only one secure pass-phrase and derive the required credentials internally.

## [0.16.2]
- Expose get-account-info functionality in FFI for launcher to consume.
- Fix sodiumoxide to v0.0.10 as the new released v0.0.12 does not support rustc-serializable types anymore and breaks builds.
- Update dependencies

## [0.16.1]
- Update Routing to 0.23.2
- Add logging to network events.
- Delete existing log file due to issue in v3 of log4rs which instead of truncating/appending overwrites the existing log file garbling it.
- Rustfmt and clippy errors addressed.
- Error recovery test case.
- Extract sub-errors out of Self Encryption errors and convert them to C error codes for FFI.

## [0.16.0]
- Update dependencies
- Refactor FFI as `Box::into_raw()` is stable
- Refactor FFI to deal with pointer to concrete types instead of ptr to void for more type safety
- Fix undefined behaviour in transmute to unrelated type in FFI
- Fix non-termination of background thread which got exposed after fixing the above
- Reorder Imports
- Resolve many Clippy errors
- Expose functionality to collect stats on GETs/PUTs/POSTs/DELETEs
- Error recovery for failure in intermediary steps of a composite operation (like DNS register and delete).
